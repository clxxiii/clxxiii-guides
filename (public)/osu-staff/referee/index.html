                    While your job as a referee may not be immediately obvious, your
                    job as a referee is crucial to the tournament scene. Which is what 
                    makes it the perfect role for your first time as staff. For the purposes
                    of keeping a complete guide, I'll be going over everything from the
                    software to use, to refereeing without a ref sheet, to a breakdown
                    of what I think should be the role of the ref in a behavioral situation.

                <p>
                    When it comes to refereeing, you will need some type of software to actually
                    interract with chat. One option is refereeing from in game, but it's clunky,
                    unprofessional, and there are many tournaments that don't allow that in the 
                    first place.
                    <br>
                    <br><b>Here are my top three choices for IRC Clients:</b>
                    <p>
                        <h3><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/879262">chat4osu!</a></h3>
                        <img src="../static/wiki images/chat4osu.png">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to have easy access to osu! chat and ref casually on the side,
                        chat4osu! is the most well-suited towards people that just want a simple setup.
                        It has support for hotkeys, custom notifications, and the ability to visualize 
                        the lobby using a side menu.
                        <br><br><b>Unfortunately, there's no MacOS release as of now.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/730734">Script chan</a></h3>
                        <img src="../static/wiki images/scriptchan.png">

                    <p>
                        Script chan is the ultimate referee tool. It is completely overkill
                        and I love it. It's got the ability to manage and create teams, manage mappools,
                        use discord webhooks to post match results, automatic score keeping and posting,
                        almost anything you could need in a client you have with Script chan (except for hotkeys).
                        <br><br><b>This client only works on windows.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3><a href="https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/">KiwiIRC</a></h3>
                        <img src="../static/wiki images/kiwiIRC.png">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        KiwiIRC is by far the most compatible client you can get. It's all hosted on the web,
                        but it has virtually no features. It wasn't made for osu in the first place. However,
                        if you need a client in a pinch, or have an operating system that doesn't support other
                        clients, KiwiIRC is the best bet.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Which does CLXXIII use?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I rarely use KiwiIRC, but I have in the past when I needed to from a different computer
                        where I didn't have my normal software installed. If it's a 1v1 tournament, or a smaller
                        tournament I will use chat4osu. If it's a larger tournament, or one that I've already set 
                        up in Script chan, I will use both chat4osu for chat, and Script chan for the scorekeeping
                        features.

                <p>
                    When you're using an IRC client, you can't interact with a multiplayer lobby like you are used
                    to. That's where the <span class="code">!mp</span> commands come in. For nearly every action you
                    can make in a multi lobby, you can make using <span class="code">!mp</span> commands. Including 
                    some things you can't do regularly.
