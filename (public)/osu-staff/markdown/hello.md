## Introduction

I've wanted to keep an archive of all my tournament knowledge.
I've started this website so we can easily give links to people asking for help,
and to better improve the osu! tournament community as a whole.

If you're reading this document and you have anything important to add, feel free to
send me a DM on discord!

## About Me

I first started playing the game in June of 2018. I was an incredibly
casual player, but I watched big tournaments like Corsace and OWC, and
wished to be a part of them. So a year and a half later, and hours and
hours of tourney experience, `I'm here`!

## Special Thanks

Obviously, I didn't learn everything there is to know about osu!
tournaments myself, so here's an awesome group of people that
helped me do that!

-   **khz**: He literally taught me how to ref. I wouldn't be here without him
-   **IceDynamix**: His spreadsheets effectively taught me how to use google sheets
-   **Juniper**: I got most of my skills out of helping with her tournament
-   **You** for reading this!
-   Many others that I am probably forgetting
